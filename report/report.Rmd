## Introduction

While telemarketing might be considered as a cornerstone of modern advertising strategies by some companies, its role is highly questionable and sometimes it is viewed as a total waste of resources by others^[https://www.prospectresearch.co.uk/blog/telemarketing-still-effective/]. Here we attempt to analize affect of telemarketing on attracting new clients in a finance industry by looking at the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term
deposits recorded by a Portuguese retail bank. We apply multiple statistical methods and analyze outcomes of two separate models:

1. (objective 1 model title!!!). We found that ...

## Data Description

Our group focused on the Portuguese Bank Marketing data set^[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing]. The data is a result
of a direct marketing campaign performed by a Portuguese bank. The bank collected data from May 2008 to November 2010 and the data consist of 45,211 observations and 17 variables. The target response is a binary, categorical variable indicating whether a client subscribed to a
deposit or not. For a complete list of variables please refer to \autoref{table1}.

## Exploratory Analysis

For our analysis we've used all variables. We separated variables into categorical and numerical and examined each group separately. 

By looking at the histograms and boxplots of numeric variables in \autoref{fig2} and \autoref{fig1} we found that _duration_, _balance_, _campaign_ and _previous_ variables might have an impact on our binary respone, while _age_ has no apparant effect on it. 

Count plots in \autoref{fig3} highlighted that data is unbalanced. Also, we found that _day_ doesn not seem to have an impact on our dependent variable. 

We decided to train all our models on balanced and unbalanced samples taken from the original data.  
For balanced sample we took 2500 'yes' data points and a random sample of 2500 'no' responses. For unbalanced sample we simply randomly chosen 5000 data points from our original dataset. 

For our test sample we selected 1000 data points which do not overlap with neither balanced, nor unbalanced samples

All dataset turned out to be clean and no imputation was nesessary.
