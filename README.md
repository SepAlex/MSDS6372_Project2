# MSDS 6372 Project 2 - Using classification methods to determine an outcome of a telemarketing campaign. 

While telemarketing might be considered as a cornerstone of modern advertising strategies by some companies, its role is highly questionable and sometimes it is viewed as a total waste of resources by others^[https://www.prospectresearch.co.uk/blog/telemarketing-still-effective/]. Here we attempt to analyze the effect of telemarketing on attracting new clients in a finance industry by looking at the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits recorded by a Portuguese retail bank. We apply multiple statistical methods and analyze outcomes of various models:

1. Logistic Regression Models. We have built two models that can be used to predict our binary outcome and to interpret effects of predictors.
1. We found that the Linear Discriminant Analysis model performs very poorly, in part due to the fact that only a handful of variables in the dataset are continuous.
1. Non-parametric model. This model has a slightly better performance than the Linear Regession models but is not easily interpretable.
